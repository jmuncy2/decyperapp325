# About See It, Say It

## Introduction
In 2024, many families face significant time constraints as both parents work, which affects their ability to spend time with their children. For young children, a lot of learning happens at home. With many married-couple families having both parents working, the home learning environment can sometimes lack the guidance that children need. Educational apps and tools that promote independent learning for children are therefore especially valuable, allowing children to continue learning independently while providing parents with peace of mind that their child is engaging in educational content.  See It, Say It! addresses the challenge parents and educators face in making learning engaging and exciting by allowing children to explore their surroundings while simultaneously learning new languages. By doing so, See It, Say It! reduces the reliance on parents and educators when children are curious about a new object, animal, or plant. Additionally, it fosters a love for reading and language learning in kids. See It, Say It! can foster their love for reading and allow them to expand their vocabulary by incorporating a feature where, after a child takes a picture of an object, it provides a brief definition of that object. It can also promote an interest in learning languages by providing the translation of the object in different languages, which is essential in our increasingly global society.
